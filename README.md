# incredible-sentence

This is my first project in school that taught me to code a Full Stack App in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and PHP

This is a copy of the original repository that I unfortunately do not have access to as it is currently in the hands of the original creator, my Professor. Which is a huge bummer because there were a lot of great github commits that no one but me will be able to see. At the very least, please enjoy the code that I worked at when finishing up my Intermediate Web Development class during the year of 2021.
